# Speakers Who Want a Platform

## Rationale 
Often, we find speaker lists or panels at conferences and other events that lack
people from underrepresented groups. At times, we hear the excuse that there
aren't enough people from underrepresented groups to reach out to or that they
couldn't find any that wanted to participate.  This list aims to fix that
problem. Please check out the [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for guidelines for
contributing.
